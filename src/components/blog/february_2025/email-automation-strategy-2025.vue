    <p>
      For every new client who books straight away, there are dozens who need more time. That’s where email automation comes in. When done right, it keeps you in front of your audience — educating, building trust, and gently guiding them toward a decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2025, the best Melbourne businesses aren’t blasting spam — they’re sending thoughtful, relevant messages based on where each lead is in their journey.
    </p>

    <h2>📧 What Is Email Automation, Really?</h2>

    <p>
      It’s not just “set and forget” newsletters. Email automation is about building **sequences** that trigger when users take action (or don’t). Think welcome emails, abandoned cart flows, nurture drips, or reactivation campaigns.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal? Stay top of mind, answer objections, and move someone closer to working with you.
    </p>

    <h2>📥 5 Automation Flows Every Business Should Consider</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Welcome Series:</strong> Introduce your brand, values, and services over 2–5 emails.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Lead Magnet Delivery:</strong> After someone downloads a guide or signs up, follow up with helpful tips or case studies.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Abandoned Booking:</strong> For services or ecommerce — follow up when someone clicks but doesn’t finish.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Post-Service Thank You:</strong> Ask for feedback, upsell, or invite to refer someone else.</li>
      <li><strong>5. Re-engagement Flow:</strong> Win back cold leads with a new offer or story-driven campaign.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚙️ Our Favourite Tools (For Any Budget)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>MailerLite:</strong> Great for beginners. Free up to 1,000 subscribers.</li>
      <li><strong>ConvertKit:</strong> Powerful tagging + ideal for creators or service providers.</li>
      <li><strong>Klaviyo:</strong> Best for ecommerce flows (especially Shopify).</li>
      <li><strong>ActiveCampaign:</strong> A full CRM + automation combo with deep segmentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Tips for Keeping Automation Human</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Write like a person — not a brand script.</li>
      <li>Use first names and smart subject lines (“Hey Sarah, quick question”)</li>
      <li>Share a personal story or insight — not just another pitch</li>
      <li>Send fewer emails, but make them more useful</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      Email isn’t dead. It’s just gotten smarter — and more valuable. When your business speaks at the right time, with the right message, leads don’t go cold… they come back warm and ready.
