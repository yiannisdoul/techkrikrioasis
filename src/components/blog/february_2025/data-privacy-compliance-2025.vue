    <p>
      If your website has a contact form, uses Google Analytics, or runs Facebook Ads, you’re collecting user data — and that comes with legal responsibility. In 2025, data privacy is no longer just for big corporations. Small businesses in Melbourne are expected to comply, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Australia is aligning closer with global standards like GDPR (Europe) and CCPA (California), which means transparency, consent, and protection are now the baseline — not the bonus.
    </p>

    <h2>🔍 What Counts as “Data Collection”?</h2>

    <p>
      You might be collecting more than you realise:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Contact forms (name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Newsletter signups or lead magnets</li>
      <li>Analytics tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel</li>
      <li>Embedded tools (e.g. chatbots, CRMs, video players)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If a user submits info or is tracked in any way — you’re responsible for how that data is handled.
    </p>

    <h2>⚖️ Key Requirements for Compliance in 2025</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cookie Consent:</strong> Show a cookie banner with clear “Accept” / “Reject” options, especially if you use trackers.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> Clearly explain what data you collect, why, where it’s stored, and who it’s shared with.</li>
      <li><strong>Form Disclaimers:</strong> Let users know what happens with their submitted data (e.g. “We’ll email you once, no spam.”)</li>
      <li><strong>Email Opt-in Clarity:</strong> Don’t auto-subscribe users. Use explicit tick boxes where needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Deletion Option:</strong> Provide a way for users to request their data be removed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔧 Tools to Make It Easier</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>CookieYes</strong> – add a consent banner in minutes</li>
      <li><strong>Termly / iubenda</strong> – generate privacy policies based on your tech stack</li>
      <li><strong>Zoho Forms / Tally</strong> – include inline disclaimers or opt-in logic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      Data privacy isn’t just about ticking boxes — it’s about respecting your users. When people know you take care of their data, they’re more likely to trust you, buy from you, and refer you.
