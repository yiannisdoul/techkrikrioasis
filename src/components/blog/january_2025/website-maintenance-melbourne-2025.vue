    <p>
      Your website is live, business is rolling, and you’ve finally stopped thinking about web design. Job done, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Not quite.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2025, websites are living, breathing digital tools — and like any tool, they need care. If your Melbourne business relies on online traffic, bookings, or leads, a broken or outdated website isn’t just an inconvenience. It’s a liability.
    </p>

    <h2>🧱 What Website Maintenance Really Means</h2>

    <p>
      Website maintenance isn’t just about updating a plugin or changing a homepage banner. It’s about making sure your entire digital experience stays secure, fast, and up to date for every visitor.
    </p>

    <p>
      A proper care plan usually includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security checks & malware scans</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Core, plugin, and theme updates</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Performance optimisations</strong> (caching, image compression, code cleanup)</li>
      <li><strong>Backups</strong> (daily or weekly, stored offsite)</li>
      <li><strong>Broken link & form testing</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Emergency fixes & uptime monitoring</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Without these, even the best-designed website can slow down, break, or become vulnerable to attack — and that affects everything from sales to SEO.
    </p>

    <h2>💻 The WordPress Factor</h2>

    <p>
      Over 40% of all websites today run on WordPress — and while it’s flexible and powerful, it also requires active care.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outdated plugins are one of the biggest reasons Melbourne business sites get hacked. And failing to update your theme or WordPress version can create fatal errors, costing hours or even days of recovery time.
    </p>

    <h2>🚨 Real Costs of Skipping Maintenance</h2>

    <p>
      Think it won’t happen to you? We've seen:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Retailers lose $5k+ in weekend sales because their site went down from a plugin conflict.</li>
      <li>Coaches have forms break mid-campaign — with no way for leads to get in touch.</li>
      <li>Google de-rank sites with security issues or malware detected.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are preventable problems — and yet they keep happening to good businesses with great websites… that weren’t maintained.
    </p>

    <h2>🛠️ What a Monthly Care Plan Looks Like</h2>

    <p>
      At Tech Kri Kri Oasis, our clients enjoy peace of mind with a simple monthly plan that covers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Site-wide updates, security checks, and emergency support</li>
      <li>Ongoing performance audits and analytics insights</li>
      <li>Priority support for content edits and form tweaks</li>
      <li>Backups to keep everything recoverable in minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That means no more DIY stress, plugin surprises, or SEO dips from downtime.
    </p>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      A website isn’t a “set and forget” asset. It’s a living part of your business that needs regular attention — especially in a competitive, fast-moving city like Melbourne.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're not sure when your last plugin update was, or if you’ve never restored a backup before — it might be time for a proper care plan.
