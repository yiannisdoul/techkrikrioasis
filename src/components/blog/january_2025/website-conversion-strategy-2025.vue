      You’ve put in the hard work. You’ve built a website. You’re running ads. You’ve optimized your SEO. And traffic is coming in — maybe even thousands of visitors a month.
    </p>

    <p>
      But here’s the problem: those visitors aren’t converting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re selling a service, taking bookings, or just trying to get people to fill out a form — if your site isn’t turning traffic into action, it’s costing you money. The good news? Conversion optimization doesn’t require a complete rebuild. It just needs a smarter strategy.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 What Is CRO, and Why Should You Care?</h2>
    <p>
      CRO stands for Conversion Rate Optimization. In plain terms, it means improving your site so that more of your visitors do what you want them to do — buy, book, subscribe, contact, download.
    </p>

    <p>
      The average website converts at 1–3%. That means for every 100 visitors, only one or two actually take meaningful action. If you can increase that to 4%, 5%, or even 10%, your revenue goes up — without needing more traffic.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 What Makes a Website Convert in 2025?</h2>
    <p>
      People don’t convert just because your service is great. They convert when your site makes it easy, clear, and trustworthy to take the next step. Here's what we focus on when helping Melbourne businesses redesign for conversion:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Clear CTAs:</strong> Buttons should be bold, visible, and unambiguous. “Get a Quote” beats “Learn More” every time.</li>
      <li><strong>2. One Primary Goal per Page:</strong> Don’t overwhelm visitors. Keep the focus tight and guide them toward action.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Trust Signals:</strong> Add testimonials, partner logos, case studies, and even client photos. People need proof.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Mobile-First Layouts:</strong> 70%+ of users are on mobile. Forms must be thumb-friendly. No pinch-zooming required.</li>
      <li><strong>5. Load Speed:</strong> If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, 40% of users will bounce. Speed = conversion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>👀 Real Examples: Fixes That Boost Conversions</h2>
    <p>
      At Tech Kri Kri Oasis, we recently helped a Melbourne roofing company triple their bookings by adding three simple things: a “Get a Free Quote” button on every section, a visible phone number, and Google reviews on the homepage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another client, a digital coach, saw a 2.5x lift in signups after we simplified their landing page and removed all unnecessary distractions.
    </p>

    <p>
      These aren’t fancy design hacks. They’re grounded in human behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>📊 Measure, Then Improve</h2>
    <p>
      One of the best things you can do is install a heatmap tool like Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity. These let you watch how users move through your site, where they click, and where they drop off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Combine that data with Google Analytics to understand bounce rates, session durations, and form abandonment — and suddenly you’ll know exactly what needs fixing.
    </p>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re spending money on traffic but your website isn’t converting, that’s not just a tech issue — it’s a business issue.
    </p>
