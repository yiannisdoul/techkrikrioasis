    <p>
      When people think about cybersecurity, they often imagine billion-dollar tech companies, government breaches, or high-level hackers operating from dark rooms. But here’s the truth in 2025: the majority of cyberattacks are hitting small and medium businesses — including local operators right here in Melbourne.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why? Because most SMEs still think “we’re too small to be targeted.” That mindset makes them the perfect target. And cybercriminals know it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you're a freelance designer in Fitzroy, a retail store in South Yarra, or a digital agency in the CBD — your data, your client files, and even your business reputation are vulnerable if you’re not taking the right precautions.
    </p>

    <h2>🔐 The Most Common Threats for Small Businesses in 2025</h2>

    <p>
      Cyberattacks are no longer complex operations requiring elite skills. Many threats are automated and opportunistic. The most common attacks we’re seeing include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Phishing emails:</strong> Designed to trick you or your staff into clicking malicious links or giving up passwords.</li>
      <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Where your system is locked and held hostage until a ransom is paid.</li>
      <li><strong>Credential stuffing:</strong> Using leaked passwords from other platforms to break into your email, website, or systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Website defacement:</strong> Especially common on WordPress sites with outdated plugins or weak admin credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These aren’t hypothetical. We’ve seen Melbourne businesses lose access to their sites, have customer data stolen, or be taken offline for days — all from preventable issues.
    </p>

    <h2>🛡️ Practical Security Steps You Can Take Today</h2>

    <p>
      You don’t need an enterprise IT team to be secure — just a few smart habits and the right setup. Here are the essentials every Melbourne business should implement:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use a password manager:</strong> Tools like Bitwarden or 1Password generate and store secure, unique passwords.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable 2FA:</strong> Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of protection — crucial for emails, banks, and CMS logins.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep plugins updated:</strong> Especially on WordPress — outdated themes and plugins are the most common entry point for attackers.</li>
      <li><strong>Backup regularly:</strong> Use automatic daily or weekly cloud backups for your website and important data.</li>
      <li><strong>Install security plugins:</strong> Wordfence, Sucuri, or iThemes Security are solid choices for WordPress users.</li>
      <li><strong>Educate your team:</strong> Human error is still the biggest risk. Run short training on spotting phishing emails and secure password use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌐 Protecting Your Website (Especially WordPress)</h2>

    <p>
      Your website is your digital storefront — and if it gets hacked, it can lead to downtime, reputation damage, and even legal issues under Australian data privacy laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Tech Kri Kri Oasis, we always set up firewalls, SSL encryption, login protection, and off-site backups as standard for client sites. It’s peace of mind — and it's the new minimum requirement in 2025.
    </p>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      Don’t wait until after a cyberattack to take action. With just a few proactive steps, you can protect your business, your customers, and your peace of mind.
