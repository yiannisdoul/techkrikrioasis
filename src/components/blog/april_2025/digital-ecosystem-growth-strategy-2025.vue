    <p>
      In 2025, digital isn’t just about “having a website.” It’s about creating an interconnected system that helps your business attract, convert, and retain customers automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most Melbourne businesses still operate in silos — they hire someone for SEO, someone else for social, and manage emails on their own. The result? Confusion, overlap, and missed opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>🌐 What Is a Digital Ecosystem?</h2>

    <p>
      A digital ecosystem is a set of connected platforms and tools — working together — to deliver value across every customer touchpoint.
    </p>

    <p>It typically includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>🧱 A fast, responsive website (your foundation)</li>
      <li>🔍 SEO + content strategy to drive visibility</li>
      <li>📧 Email automation to nurture and upsell</li>
      <li>📱 Social media for reach and brand engagement</li>
      <li>⚙️ CRM and analytics to track and optimise</li>
      <li>📲 Mobile app or client portal (when needed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 Why It Works Better Than Piecemeal Tactics</h2>

    <p>
      When everything’s connected:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your leads flow from Google to CRM to email — without friction</li>
      <li>Your blog and social posts reinforce your offers and funnels</li>
      <li>You can track user journeys and spot what’s working (or not)</li>
      <li>Automation replaces repetitive manual tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 What We Recommend at Tech Kri Kri Oasis</h2>

    <p>
      We help Melbourne businesses:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Audit their current digital assets (site, socials, tools, etc.)</li>
      <li>Consolidate where needed — and connect the dots</li>
      <li>Integrate tools like Notion, Zapier, Calendly, GA4, Stripe, and email flows</li>
      <li>Design content strategies that feed SEO, email, and engagement together</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚀 Starting Your Own Ecosystem</h2>

    <p>
      You don’t need everything at once. Start simple:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Website + Google Business + 1 social channel + email flow</li>
      <li>Add analytics and CRM next</li>
      <li>Automate where possible</li>
      <li>Track. Refine. Repeat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      The best-performing businesses in 2025 aren’t working harder — they’re working smarter, with connected systems doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes.
