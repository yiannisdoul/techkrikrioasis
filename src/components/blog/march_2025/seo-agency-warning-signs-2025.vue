    <p>
      SEO is not dead. But trust in SEO agencies? That’s another story.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hear it constantly from Melbourne clients: “We paid $1,500/month for six months and got… nothing.” Vague reports. No traffic lift. No leads. Just promises.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what’s going wrong — and how can business owners get real SEO results in 2025?
    </p>

    <h2>🚩 Red Flags Your SEO Agency Might Be Wasting Your Budget</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. They can’t explain what they’re doing in plain English</strong></li>
      <li><strong>2. You never see actual rankings, traffic, or lead improvements</strong></li>
      <li><strong>3. They talk about "keywords" — but not content, UX, or site speed</strong></li>
      <li><strong>4. Everything they do is “technical” and “behind the scenes”</strong></li>
      <li><strong>5. Their blog posts are AI-generated fluff with no local value</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 What SEO Actually Requires in 2025</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>💡 A fast, mobile-first website that’s crawlable and user-friendly</li>
      <li>📍 Location-specific service pages and blog content</li>
      <li>📈 Real Google Analytics + Search Console data (not vanity slides)</li>
      <li>📞 Strategy tied to real leads — not just rankings</li>
      <li>🔗 Manual link building through partnerships, citations, PR (not spammy backlinks)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📍 Local SEO Is Your Biggest Opportunity</h2>

    <p>
      For Melbourne-based businesses, your Google Business Profile + suburb-level landing pages can drive real leads. But most agencies still use generic national strategies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don’t waste money targeting the whole country — win your backyard first.
    </p>
