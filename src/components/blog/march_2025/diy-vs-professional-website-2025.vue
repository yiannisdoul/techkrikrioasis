    <p>
      You‚Äôve got a great business idea. You need a website. But now you‚Äôre staring at ads for Wix, Squarespace, and Shopify templates‚Ä¶ all promising to get you ‚Äúonline in minutes.‚Äù Tempting, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, you‚Äôve heard quotes from local web developers ranging from $3K to $15K. What‚Äôs the right move?
    </p>

    <p>
      Let‚Äôs break it down ‚Äî because the answer depends entirely on where you are in your business journey and what you need your website to *do*.
    </p>

    <h2>üß∞ DIY Builders (Wix, Squarespace, Shopify Templates)</h2>

    <p>
      These platforms are perfect if you:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Need to get something live ASAP</li>
      <li>Have a small budget (under $2K)</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt need much customisation or backend logic</li>
      <li>Aren‚Äôt relying on SEO, lead gen, or automation (yet)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For local artists, freelancers, or side projects ‚Äî DIY makes sense. You‚Äôll trade flexibility for speed, but it can work if done cleanly.
    </p>

    <h2>üß† When It‚Äôs Time to Go Pro</h2>

    <p>
      If your website needs to <em>perform</em> ‚Äî not just exist ‚Äî you‚Äôll outgrow the DIY tools quickly. Consider a custom WordPress or Webflow build when you need:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Custom forms, booking tools, or CRM integration</li>
      <li>Fast loading, SEO optimization, and blog functionality</li>
      <li>A scalable backend for ecommerce or gated content</li>
      <li>Mobile-first, responsive UX with professional polish</li>
      <li>A unique design that reflects your brand (not a template)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üí∏ Let‚Äôs Talk Cost vs Return</h2>

    <p>
      DIY websites might cost $300‚Äì$1,000 upfront. But if they don‚Äôt generate leads, rank on Google, or feel trustworthy‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre not really cheap.
    </p>

    <p>
      A custom site may cost more upfront, but it gives you:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Better conversions</li>
      <li>Higher search rankings</li>
      <li>Trust from high-end clients</li>
      <li>Support and long-term flexibility</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Hybrid Option: Customising a Template</h2>

    <p>
      At Tech Kri Kri Oasis, we often meet Melbourne business owners who start with Wix ‚Äî but soon want more. In some cases, we migrate their content and redesign it using WordPress + Divi (our in-house platform with lifetime access).
    </p>

    <p>
      This lets them:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Keep control of their content</li>
      <li>Add professional visuals + structure</li>
      <li>Scale when ready (SEO, analytics, blog, shop)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìå Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      Not every website needs to be custom ‚Äî but every business deserves a website that reflects its goals, brand, and growth stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Tech Kri Kri Oasis, we help Melbourne businesses choose the right path ‚Äî and build sites that don‚Äôt just ‚Äúgo live,‚Äù but go the distance.
