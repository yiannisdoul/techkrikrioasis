      Think about the last time you bought something online. Chances are, you didn’t click “Buy Now” until you scrolled through the reviews. Your potential clients are doing the same — which is why testimonials matter more than ever in 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Melbourne service businesses, client testimonials aren’t just nice-to-haves — they’re conversion tools, SEO assets, and trust builders all in one.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Why Testimonials Work</h2>

    <p>
      Testimonials provide <strong>social proof</strong>. When someone sees real people praising your work, it removes uncertainty and builds confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, BrightLocal’s 2024 study found that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>94% of consumers are more likely to use a business with positive reviews</li>
      <li>79% trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations</li>
      <li>Adding testimonials to a landing page can boost conversions by 30%+</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📦 Where to Place Testimonials (Strategically)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> Just below your intro or hero section</li>
      <li><strong>Service pages:</strong> Use relevant client stories per service</li>
      <li><strong>Pricing pages:</strong> Place testimonials near CTAs or pricing tiers</li>
      <li><strong>Landing pages:</strong> Include 1–2 powerful quotes + logos</li>
      <li><strong>Google Business Profile:</strong> Keep reviews flowing for local SEO trust</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📝 How to Get Better Testimonials</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Don’t ask “Can you write a testimonial?”</strong> Instead, ask specific questions like:
        <ul>
          <li>“What problem did we help solve?”</li>
          <li>“What was your experience working with us?”</li>
          <li>“Would you recommend us to others in Melbourne?”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Make it easy:</strong> Use a form or even interview your client and write it for them</li>
      <li><strong>Include name, title, company & headshot</strong> — authenticity matters</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎥 Pro Tip: Turn Text Reviews into Video</h2>

    <p>
      A short 30-second video from a real client can outperform a block of text 10x over. Even if recorded on Zoom or iPhone, the human element adds instant credibility.
    </p>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      Testimonials aren’t just “proof” — they’re persuasion. They turn browsers into believers and help you stand out in a crowded market.
